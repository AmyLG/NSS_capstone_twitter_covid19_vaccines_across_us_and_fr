# Covid-19 vaccine skepticism tracked on social media across USA and France

The purpose of this study is to understand the public's perception on COVID-19 vaccines in France and in the United States.

## Background
In mid-December 2020, the FDA authorized the first Covid-19 vaccine. While it was a great news after months of incertitude and fear due to the pandemic, numerous people were skeptical about a vaccine developed  within one year and were strongly opinionated on social media. Social media is a valuable source of public feedback and can provide a real-time view of public's opinion. However, can social media predict if the population will get vaccinated? Since doses are still limited and vaccines are stables only for a short period of time, it would be more adequate to first distribute them in area were people will most likely get vaccinated.


## Motivation and Consideration
People's reaction toward COVID-19 vaccines have been different between countries. While vaccination rate is promising in the United States, France which is known to be one of the most vaccine-skeptical nations in the world is behind the United States as well as other European countries.
France is the only European country where written consent is required before receiving the vaccine which can lead to delays. Moreover, the number of doses are more limited than in the United States and the campaign of vaccinations are slow.
